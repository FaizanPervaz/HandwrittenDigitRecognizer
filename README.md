HandwrittenDigitRecognizer is a Python code that utilizes the MNIST dataset and a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits. The code loads the dataset, normalizes the images, builds a sequential model using dense layers, compiles and trains the model, and saves it for future use. It also provides functionality to predict the labels of user-provided handwritten digit images. This code serves as a practical tool for digit recognition tasks and can be used for various applications such as optical character recognition (OCR). The code is written in Python, leveraging the TensorFlow library for deep learning functionalities and OpenCV for image processing.
